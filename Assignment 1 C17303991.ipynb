    "#INTRODUCTION:\n",
    "# Using image processing skills to restore light damaged photos to their former glory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#ASSIGNMENT:\n",
    "#1. Convert to an appropriate colourspace to exaggerate the difference between damaged and undamaged areas so as to identify the damage.\n",
    "#2. Enhance the images to increase contrast and definition.\n",
    "#3. Remove any colour introduced by damage.\n",
    "#4. The final image should be an enhanced version of the original, with little or no distinction between damaged and undamaged parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#STRUCTURE OF CODE:\n",
    "#1. Import the necessary packages\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Read in the image\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Convert Image to appropriate colourspace for edge detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#4a. If lines detected: \n",
    "    # The code dyanmically locates any faded rectangular areas in the image using the canny function,\n",
    "    # and using the HoughLineP function, the corners of this rectangular area can be identified.\n",
    "    # using those corners, the difference can be found in the greyscale image.\n",
    "    # This difference can then be subtracted from the greysclae image, to give the output image\n",
    "    # The output image is showed, alongside the original image\n",
    "    \n",
    "#4b. If no lines detected: remove saturation, blur, shaprne and then weighted addd the blur and sharpened images to get new output, show the relevant output images\n",
    "    #The code converts the image to HSV and removes the saturation to remove any staining,\n",
    "    # The image is blurred, then sharpened, and the blurred image is added to the sharpened image using the addWeighted function\n",
    "    # The added image result is the output, and shown alongside the original image.\n",
